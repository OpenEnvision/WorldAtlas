    The Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) calculates perceptual
    similarity between two images. LPIPS essentially computes the similarity between
    the activations of two image patches for some pre-defined network. This measure has
    been shown to match human perception well. A low LPIPS score means that image
    patches are perceptual similar.

    We use the TorchMetrics implementation:
